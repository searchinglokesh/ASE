I'll help you prepare comprehensive notes on Project Scheduling and Management based on the document.

# Project Scheduling and Management

## Project Scheduling: General Purpose

### Definition
- Distributes estimated effort across project duration
- Allocates effort to specific tasks
- Converts action plan into an operational timetable

### Scheduling Perspectives
1. **First View**: End date already established and fixed (Most common)
2. **Second View**: Rough bounds discussed, end date set by developers

## Factors Influencing Project Schedule
1. Project size
2. Mission criticality
3. Requirements stability
4. Communication ease (customer/developer)
5. Applicable technology future
6. Performance constraints
7. Embedded/non-embedded characteristics
8. Project staff
9. Reengineering staff

## Key Observation
- Effort increases rapidly as delivery time reduces

## Project Scheduling Process
1. Define project objectives
2. Develop Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
3. Identify precedence relationships
4. Estimate task duration
5. Determine resource requirements
6. Draw PERT diagram
7. Apply Critical Path Method (CPM)
8. Construct Gantt Chart
9. Reallocate resources if necessary
10. Continuously monitor and revise time estimates

## Project Scope Definition
Helps develop project plan by detailing:
- Project objectives
- Deliverables
- Milestones
- Technical requirements
- Limits and exclusions
- Customer review

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
### Definition
"Logical decomposition of work to be performed, focusing on natural work subdivision"

### Characteristics
- Hierarchical project task decomposition
- Shows task breakdown into subtasks
- Does not show duration
- No precedence indication

### Approaches
1. **Work-Based**: List all work items
2. **Deliverable-Based**: 
   - List deliverables
   - Determine order
   - Identify necessary activities

## Project Management Techniques: PERT and CPM

### PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)
- Network where nodes represent tasks
- Arrows describe precedence relations
- Uses multiple time estimates:
  1. Most likely time
  2. Optimistic time
  3. Pessimistic time
- Allows uncertainty in activity times

### CPM (Critical Path Method)
- Developed for maintenance projects
- Activities represented as nodes
- Identifies critical path
- Controls project progression

### Merged CPM/PERT Characteristics
- Graphically display activity relationships
- Estimate project duration
- Identify critical activities
- Estimate slack

## Slack and Float
- Defines delay tolerance for non-critical tasks
- Calculated as: Float = LF - ES - duration
- Determines task scheduling flexibility

## Gantt Chart
### Characteristics
- Bar chart showing task start/finish dates
- Displays:
  - Task names
  - Start/finish dates
  - Dependencies
  - Durations
  - Resources

### Monitoring
- Updated by filling bars proportional to work completed
- Progress reviewed via vertical line
- Indicates schedule status

### Limitations
- Unwieldy for complex projects
- Difficult with numerous tasks

## Staffing and Rescheduling
### Resource Smoothing
- Reallocate resources
- Reschedule non-critical tasks
- Staff utilization calculation

### Crashing Critical Activities
- Reduce critical activity duration
- Allocate more resources
- Potential productivity and cost implications

## Milestones
- Important checkpoints
- Interim project goals
- Help identify scheduling problems early
